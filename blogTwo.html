                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>
                        As we all know, to make any website or webpages we use HTML as a standard language.
                        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. With a basic knowledge of HTML we can structure the whole website, and with the addition of CSS to it we can add styling to it. To make website interactive we add JavaScript. But without HTML, we won’t be able to add CSS or JavaScript.
                        Here’s the HTML code:
                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                        <html>
                        <head>
                        <title>Page Title</title>
                        </head>
                        <body>
                        <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
                        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                        </body>
                        </html>
                        The HTML code starts and end with angle brackets.
                        The above code is the starting part of every HTML file, in which we can use html elements and tags. We will be going through some of the popular tags and elements of HTML.
                        
                        HTML Tags:-
                        One of the important feature of HTML is the use of angle brackets which is also termed as Tags.
                        “< >” : This is opening tag.
                        “</>” :  This is the closing tag.
                        
                        HTML elements :
                        An Element is the opening tag, closing tag and the content that ids included between the two tags.
                        
                        In the above HTML code example, we can see that the more than one element is nested in one BODY element. And there is Head element present apart form body.
                        Head consist of Title and meta tags.
                        Both head and body element is enclosed in html tag, which holds all other element present in that document.
                        
                        Ex:- <html>
                        <head>
                          <meta charset="utf-8" />
                        <title>Page Title</title>
                        </head>
                        <body>
                        <h1>This is a heading.</h1>
                        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
                        </body>
                        </html>
                        Some of the description of the elements and tags are as follows:-
                        1.	<html></html>: The <html> element. This element wraps all the content on the page. It is sometimes known as the root element.
                        2.	<head></head>: The <head> element. This element acts as a container for everything you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content the page will show to viewers. This includes keywords and a page description that would appear in search results, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. You will learn more about this in the next article of the series.
                        3.<meta charset="utf-8">: The <meta> element. This element represents metadata that cannot be represented by other HTML meta-related elements, like <base>, <link>, <script>, <style> or <title>. The charset attributes sets the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. 
                        4.<title></title>: The <title> element. This sets the title of the page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. 
                        5.	<body></body>: The <body> element. This contains all the content that displays on the page, including text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
