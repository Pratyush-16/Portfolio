        I am Pratyush, and currently working as a software engineer at HCL.  Here I am sharing my journey, and how I get myself into coding and development.
    </p>
    <p>
        My previous profile was non-technical. I was not learning anything new, and also not upskilling myself. I was in a loop, as the work followed the same process and procedure.  I wanted to come out of it. So I started learning Java and practicing coding questions.
        I was learning only by watching tutorials and not doing hands-on practice. I eventually started getting stuck because that didnâ€™t help me in building my logic.
    </p>

<p>
    I was not consistent also.  Whatever I learned in those videos/tutorials, I never implemented them. I knew the term theoretically but never practiced them. Also hopping into new things was also one of the reasons
    It is most important for anyone to implement and practice the topic learned from tutorials.  
</p>

<p>
    Later on, I started doing hands-on by learning new topics and developing minor projects. The outcome was so fruitful that it gave me confidence and also helped me in getting a break from the tutorial loop. 
Implementing things and being consistent is the key to being good at something. At first, things might not seem easy, but doing it on regular basis makes it easier to work on.
